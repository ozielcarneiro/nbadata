Collection of Java codes used to copy the 2013-14 NBA season boxscores from ESPN.com. Each file is responsible for one action as it relates to the data. As they were developed and tested independently the overall process hasn't been unified, so each of the 4 main files (Acquisition, Filtering, Html2Xml, Xml2DB) have to be run separately.

Acquisition.java is responsible for saving the full html files that ESPN.com uses to display each boxscore for a game. Each file is saved by an id number, which corresponds to the id ESPN.com uses in their file structure.

Filtering.java extracts from the full html file, only the table that holds the relevant data.

Html2Xml.java transforms the html tables into xml files.

Xml2DB.java reads the information from the xml files, transforms them into Java Persistence (JPA) Entity objects, which are then stored in a mySQL database schema (defined by the file nbadb.sql) in the localhost.

The other files define the entity objects, and some entity manipulation methods.

The html and sml files copied and generated by this project are available in the folders "files", "filteredHTML" and "xml".
